# Lab 2 website

**Made By:** Lawrence Nobuyoshi Lorbiecki

For this lab I created a repository and website that is a travel guide for the city of Yokohama which is where my family lives. I used styling in CSS from W3 Schools as well as the format given to us to create my website.
One issue that I ran into was my background image not working when I put it in the css file and called it but when I put it directly into my html it worked just fine. This alone took forever to debug because I really had
no understanding of why this was not working especially since it wasn't the pathing that didn't work. Looking back on this project if I could do anything better I would have done more customization to the nav bar but I had
a tough time creating anything that worked in that regard. Finally, I plan on using this website template in the future for my portfolio. I am turning this in very late because I was sick but emailed Dr.Zhao about it.
